This is a simple CRUD app for managing orders on Amazon. It was built for learning purposes just to get a hands-on experience in React Native, Node.js and get to know how things work in JavaScript.
Feel free to clone this app, modify it or use parts of it. Doesnt matter if you use them commercially or just for fun, it would be great if it helps you out in any way possible.
